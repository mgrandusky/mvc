MVC architectural pattern is almost in everywhere today, whether you are working on Java, C#, PHP, iOS projects. This might not be 100% exact, but PHP community has the most amount of MVC frameworks. Today you might be using Zend, tomorrow on another project you might have to change to Yii or Laravel or CakePHP. If you are new to MVC frameworks and you just download one from the official website, you might feel overwhelmed when you look at the frameworkâ€™s source code, yes, it is complex, as these popular frameworks are not written in a month - they are published, refined, tested again and again, and the functionalities are added constantly. So from my experience, knowing the core design methodologies of MVC  framework is critical, otherwise you might feel that you will have to learn another framework and another framework again and again when you get new projects using new frameworks.
